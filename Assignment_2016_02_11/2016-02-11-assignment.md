## 2E1

(2) "Pr(rain|Monday)"

## 2E2

(3) "The probability that it is Monday, given that it is raining"

## 2E3

(1) "Pr(Monday|rain)"

## 2E4

I think the point is that we are making many assumptions in our globe tossing, for example that the globe is equally weighted and that its landing orientation is truly random.  So what we really can learn in the globe tossing example is just that the probability of observing water after a toss.

## 2M3

Posterior = Likelihood * Prior / Average Likelihood

Pr(Earth|land) = Pr(land | earth) * Pr (earth) / Pr(land)

Pr(land | earth) = 0.3
Pr(earth) = 0.5
Pr(land) = (1+0.3) / 2 = 0.65

Pr(Earth|land) = 0.3 * 0.5 / 0.65 = 0.2307692

## 2M4

Basically we need to count the possible paths to B/B

There are 3 ways to get a B side up on the first draw

B/B
B/B
B/W

Two of these three ways will give B on the second side.
