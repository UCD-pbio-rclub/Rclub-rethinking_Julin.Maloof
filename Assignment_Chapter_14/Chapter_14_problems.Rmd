## 14E1

Specify a distribition that the observations come from (actually each observation has a separate set of parameters).  Have the linear model use the distribution as predictors rather than the observations themselves

T_i ~ Poission(mu_i)
log(mu_i) = a + B*logPi_est
logPi_obs ~ dnorm(logPi_est_i, logPi_sigma_i)
A ~ dnorm(0,10)
B ~ dnorm(0,10)

## 14E2

## 14M1

They all come from the same distribution, with mean v and sd sigma_n
