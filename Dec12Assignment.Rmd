## Problem 1

Rememebr the tomato data set generated by Pepe; we first looked at this when we were working on Chapter 9.  35 accessions for seven species were grown in sun and shade.  

Access whether there is evidence for total length ("totleng") response to shade and whether this response varies by species.  Consier whether including accession ("acs"), shelf ("shelf"), flat ("flat") using adaptive priors improves the model fit.

```{r}
tomato <- read.csv("Assignment_Chapter_09/TomatoR2CSHL.csv")
names(tomato)
summary(tomato)
```

consider brewslow and cane in the "boot" package
```{r}
seed <- read.csv("germin")
```
