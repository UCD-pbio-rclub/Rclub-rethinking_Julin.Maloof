# Chapter 8

## 8E1

The simple Metropolis algorhithim requires that the proposal distribution be symmetric

## 8E2

Gibbs sampling achieves its efficiency by using conjugate priors.  Maybe you don't want to use conjugate priors. Also becomes very ineffecient with large numbers of parameters.

## 8E3

HMC requires cannot handle discrete parameters.  This is because it is sampling the probability space by gliding through it, and it is unclear how to glide between discrete points.

## 8E4

Because there is autocorrelation in MCMC chains samples are not independent and the effective number of samples is reduced.  Neff estimates this.

## 8E5

Rhat should approach 1 (from above)

## 8E6

Should stabilize

## 8M1
